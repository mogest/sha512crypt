# sha512crypt.pw

This is the source for a simple site that creates a sha512 crypt (the ones that start with `$6$`) in javascript.

You can use the site at <http://sha512crypt.pw>.

The meat of the computation comes from two javascript libraries which are licensed under BSD.

The rest of the files to glue them together are copyright Roger Nesbitt and licensed under MIT.
